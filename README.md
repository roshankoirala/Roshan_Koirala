## Welcome!


My name is Roshan Koirala. I am a data scientist. I have Ph.D. in particle physics. 


Please find my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roshan-koirala/) profile here. 


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/roshankoirala/Roshan_Koirala/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/roshankoirala/Roshan_Koirala/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
